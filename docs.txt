code-box is a simple syntax-highlighted text editor.

To get started apply the provided 'style.css' in the header,
and 'codebox.js' at the end of the body.

The code-box will fit whatever container it is put into
(with the exception of very small ones).

Options:
 - Apply the 'folder' attribute to the code-box element to set the
folder of files to be put into the code box.
 - Apply the 'editable' attribute to the code-box element to set
 weather the code box should be editable (true by default).
